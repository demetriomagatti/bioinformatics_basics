# Bioinformatics basics
Exercises from online tutorials and classes on bioinformatics. The scope of this repo is to get acquaintance with bionformatics, form the very basics (common file extensions, most used libraries, ...) to the final steps of a task (machine learning approaches, main goals of analysis, ...). 

## Files and structure
<ul>
<li> The repository is structured so that it can be installed as a package via pip install command; this holds for advanced (but still basic) tools and functions required to solve the latest exercises. Solution for first exercises may be written as "simple" functions.
</ul>

## Exercises 

<ol>
<li> <b>DNA alignment from scratch; source: An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms, by Neil C. Jones and Pavel A. Pevzner; chapter 6, exercise .</b> <br>
        Description here
</ol>
If possible, the exercise solution (not alwasy provided by the source) will be compared with results obtained via pre-existing dedicated tools and libraries, such as bioPython.

## Notes on the project and on the jupyter notebook
